#  Control Divoom Max through Bluetooth
### this as made for divoom max but should work for divoom timebox aswell, this is based on documenation found by some timebox developers, linked below


this took way too long time, **fuck divoom**

actually useful stuff (not you divoom), thanks for the documentation:  
- https://github.com/RomRider/node-divoom-timebox-evo/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md  
- https://github.com/d03n3rfr1tz3/hass-divoom/blob/main/custom_components/divoom/devices/divoom.py
